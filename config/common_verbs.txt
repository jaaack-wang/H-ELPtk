# The following common verbs are selected from some randomly selected files in the EMMA corpus and all have at least 50 occurrences. I also did some inspection to ensure that all included here are verbs. Nevertheless, this approach to normalize the archaic verb inflections in early modern English is a naive one, but should work for most cases as they represent some most frequently verbs that are likely to be used. The first column is the base verb, the second column the third person singular and the last the simple past tense.
